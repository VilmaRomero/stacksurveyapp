# Men and Women in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey
### A Shiny App for the 2016 Stack Overflow Survey

This app explores the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey results from 2016](https://github.com/dgrtwo/stacksurveyr). Check out [the app here](https://juliasilge.shinyapps.io/survey2016/).

In the app, the user chooses one of the questions from the survey and then the app displays

- a plot showing men's and women's responses to that question and
- the results of a chi-squared test comparing men's and women's responses.
